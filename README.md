My PowerShell scripts and configurations optimized for my development environment on PC.

## Configure your Terminal

You can quickly configure your terminal by following these guides:

1. [Set up a Custom Prompt by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/custom-prompt-setup)
2. [My Ultimate Powershell Prompt by Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/my-ultimate-powershell-prompt-with-oh-my-posh-and-the-windows-terminal)

I will continually update this `README.md` as I continually enhance my terminal.
